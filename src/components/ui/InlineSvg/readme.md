title: InlineSvg
---

The component is used to display an inline SVG image. You can set css property
`color` in the parent container to change `currentColor` inside SVG.

The component loads an image using XHR request and cache it for the subsequent
requests.

The same way as in the Image component you can pass `aspect` property to generate
placeholder with the same dimensions as the source of the image.
